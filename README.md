## 📖 Description

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server for the Discord API using [(JDA)](https://jda.wiki/),
designed to integrate Discord bots with MCP-compatible applications such as Claude, ChatGPT etc. It allows AI assistants to interact with 
Discord by managing channels, sending messages, and retrieving server information. Ideal for building powerful Discord automation and AI-driven workflows.


## 🔬 Installation

### ► 🐳 Docker Installation (Recommended)

> [!NOTE]
> Docker installation is required. Full instructions can be found on [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

#### 1) Set local env variables
```bash
export DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
export DISCORD_GUILD_ID="OPTIONAL_DEFAULT_SERVER_ID"
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=http
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Instructions for creating a Discord bot and retrieving its token can be found [here](https://discordjs.guide/legacy/preparations/app-setup).

> [!TIP]
> The `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` env variable is optional.
> 
> When provided, it sets a default Discord server ID so any tool that accepts a `guildId` parameter can omit it.

#### 2) Run the Docker container
```bash
docker run -d -i \
  --name discord-mcp \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8085:8085 \
  -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE \
  -e DISCORD_TOKEN \
  -e DISCORD_GUILD_ID \
  saseq/discord-mcp:latest
```

Default MCP endpoint URL (HTTP profile): `http://localhost:8085/mcp`

    </summary>

#### 1) Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaseQ/discord-mcp
```

#### 2) Go to the project directory

```

#### 5) Verify
```bash
docker ps --filter name=discord-mcp
curl -fsS http://localhost:8085/actuator/health

Go to: `Settings` -> `Cursor Settings` -> `MCP` -> `Add new global MCP server`

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file is the recommended approach. You may also install in a specific project by creating `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder. See [Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for more info.

        🚀 n8n Connection
    </summary>

#### Connect in n8n
1. Open n8n and add an **MCP Client** node.
2. Choose **HTTP** or **Streamable HTTP** transport (depending on your n8n version/node options).
3. Set the server URL to: `http://localhost:8085/mcp`
4. Save the node and test the connection.
5. After connecting, you can use the available Discord tools exposed by `discord-mcp` inside your workflow.

#### Notes
- If n8n is running in Docker, `localhost` may point to the n8n container itself, not your host machine.
- In that case, use the Docker service name or another reachable host, for example: `http://discord-mcp:8085/mcp`

      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Remote MCP Connector:
1. Open Claude Desktop and go to `Settings` -> `Connectors`.
2. Add a custom connector and set MCP URL to your server endpoint (for example `https://<PUBLIC_HOST>/mcp`).
3. Save and reconnect.

> Claude Desktop remote connectors are managed via Connectors UI (not `claude_desktop_config.json`).
> `http://localhost:8085/mcp` is reachable only from your machine. For Claude Desktop remote connectors, expose the endpoint with public HTTPS (for example tunnel/reverse proxy).

## Scoped history and thread tools

Configure `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`, `DISCORD_THREAD_PARENT_CHANNEL_IDS` (comma-separated
approved parent IDs), and `DISCORD_OWNER_USER_ID` for the new structured tools.
An empty scope fails closed. These restrictions apply to the new scoped tools;
the existing legacy tools retain their compatibility behavior and are not a
security boundary. Limit bot visibility to the intended channels if exposing
those legacy tools. No additional Discord permissions are requested by this patch.

`read_structured_messages` reads a configured parent directly. For a thread,
provide both `channelId` and its configured `parentChannelId`. It resolves cold
archived threads through `GET /channels/{id}`, verifies guild and parent, then
reads messages. An unapproved parent is rejected before any HTTP/JDA operation.
A thread presented with an approved parent requires one metadata lookup to
verify that relationship; a mismatch blocks history, reactor collection, and
mutation. Replies are mapped without fetching cross-channel references.

`read_structured_private_messages` accepts the configured owner **user ID**,
opens that bot-user DM directly, verifies its recipient, and returns the actual
DM channel ID. Private channel IDs cannot be substituted for user IDs. Use the
explicit author/mention IDs for identity; display names are not keys.

History is ordered by unsigned snowflake ID, including same-millisecond ties.
`after` is exclusive and `nextAfter` is the largest returned ID; `nextBefore` is
the smallest. Exactly full pages have `mayHaveMore=true`; an empty continuation
is normal. `around` returns no advancing cursors. Commit a polling checkpoint
only after successful processing, deduplicate by channel/message ID, and refresh
specific older messages to see edits/reactions; an `after` cursor is not a change feed.

`list_channel_threads(kind="active")` returns the entire authorized-parent
**cache snapshot**, ignoring the compatibility `limit` after range validation.
It never silently truncates and does not fetch Discord's guild-wide active-thread
REST endpoint. It always reports `complete=false` and explicit partial cache
coverage: cold caches and private-thread visibility cannot guarantee completeness.
Discord/JDA's initial gateway connection can still collect metadata visible to
the bot; restrict Discord channel visibility for stricter collection boundaries.
The separate legacy `list_active_threads` remains a guild-wide REST operation.

`list_archived_threads` accepts `public`, `private`, or `joined_private`. Its
versioned opaque cursors bind parent and mode. Public/private cursors use encoded
archive timestamps; joined-private cursors use thread IDs. `hasMore` comes from
Discord, and `complete` becomes true only at exhaustion. Private archive modes
are text-parent-only. History permissions, private membership, and moderator
permissions are enforced by Discord; failures are errors rather than empty pages.

`list_reaction_users` uses the same parent guard and cold-thread resolver. NORMAL
and BURST are independent modes. It accepts Unicode or custom emoji and exposes
reactor user IDs, bot flags, and an exclusive user-ID cursor. `me` on message
reaction totals denotes the bot; owner-specific decisions require the owner ID
in the reactor list.

`set_thread_archived` requires a JSON Boolean and verifies parent/guild before
PATCH. It changes only `archived`, waits for completion, and returns the
authoritative PATCH state, including locked/tag fields. Null and malformed
values are rejected before any Discord operation.

All new tools use native MCP `structuredContent`, generated `outputSchema`, and
JSON text fallback. Nullable DTO fields are optional and omitted rather than
violating the schema. Run `mvn test` for fake-Discord behavioral tests and real
local stdio JSON-RPC `tools/list`/`tools/call` tests; no production token is used.
`SpringRegistrationTest` additionally starts the complete Spring application
with the `http` profile, mocked JDA and mocked Discord REST. It checks the
assembled server and real `/mcp` HTTP responses for all six native tools,
their output schemas, and structured history content alongside legacy tools.
It does not test live Discord or the deployed endpoint.

If a client shows only legacy tools, check the deployed image digest and the
server's startup `Registered tools` count before changing tool annotations.
The current application advertises 81 tools (75 legacy plus six native).
Annotation scanning defaults to enabled; an external
`SPRING_AI_MCP_SERVER_ANNOTATION_SCANNER_ENABLED=false` override disables native
discovery. The example Compose file and earlier Docker examples still name the
upstream `saseq/discord-mcp:latest`, not the patched GHCR image. Use the intended
fork image explicitly and forward the scope variables described above in your
deployment configuration. Confirm the direct server `tools/list` response to
distinguish endpoint/image configuration from a client's cached tool catalog.
